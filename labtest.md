What is happening:

The face represents the player. The player can move left and right by pressing the left and right arrow keys. The player can only move upwards using the up arrow key whenever they are over the ladder. There is no requirement for down. When the player reaches the key, the player changes to a happy face and the key disappears.

In your solution, you should use variables, functions with parameters, the if statement and at least one loop. You can optionally use classes.
