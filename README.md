## Lab

### Learning Outcomes
- Enroll on Webcourses
- Become familiar with the syntax of Processing
- Become familiar with writing and running sketches in Processing
- Clone a git repository!
- Install Processing libraries

### Part 1 - Drawing
- Log onto Webcourses and enroll on the module GAME1003.
- Check out [the Processing reference](https://processing.org/reference/)
- Check out [Daniel Shiffman's awesome YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman)
- Check out [these Sci-Fi user interfaces made by last years OOP students](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1n0B6z4e_E5RZYrubD2pcxq0qzGy-3vr)
- Check out [these music visualisers made in Processing by last years game programming students](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW8s5i9dmqA&list=PL1n0B6z4e_E6jErrS0ScSCaVrN7KV729x)
- If you are curious, check out [some of my creature videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cW8s5i9dmqA&list=PL1n0B6z4e_E6jErrS0ScSCaVrN7KV729x)

- Look up the following methods in the [Processing language reference](http://processing.org/reference/ ) to make sure you are clear about the syntax and parameters:

* noStroke
* noFill
* line
* ellipse
* rect
* background
* stroke
* fill
* size
* arc
* triangle

Write a processing sketch to draw the following shapes:

![Sketch](images/p1.png)

![Sketch](images/p1.1.png)

![Sketch](images/p1.2.png)

I prefer to draw the shapes on paper first before I try and work out the coordinates. Try experimenting with different colours!

### Downloading a Processing game

- Download the Processing sourcecode for NILL. Click the [clone or download link here](https://github.com/skooter500/NILL)
- This will download a zip file of the code for the NILL game
- Unzip the files somewhere 
- Find the NILL folder and double click on the NILL.pde file. It should open in Processing
- You need to install the Minim library and the Game control libraries to make NILL work. Go to Sketch | Import Library | Add library to do this
- See if you can collect all the pods
- Have a look through the source code for NILL
